# Movie_Genre_Classification
Classify Movies into Various Genres based on the movie plots

# Dataset Used : 
  The Movielens 20m Movie Dataset was used for this project. The Dataset can be downloaded from [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m.zip).
  However this dataset does not contain the plot or story of the movie. To obtain the story for each movie, I used python's Wikipedia library to search and scrape the movie plots.
  
 # Models Used : 
 I used LSTM's, Bidirectional LSTM's for training. For embedding the movie plots, I used both Word2Vec as well as Glove Vectors.
